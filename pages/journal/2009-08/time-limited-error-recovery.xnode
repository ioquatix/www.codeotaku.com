	<p>I recently read about TLER on Western Digital drives. Apparently they charge more for <em>RAID</em> drives with a 7-second TLER. This is interesting to me since I deal with data storage and enclosures.</p>

	<p>Here are some more details about TLER:</p>

	</ul>
	
	<p>Basically, the problem as I interpret it is that a non-fatal error may result in the drive dropping from a <em>RAID</em> because the drive spends too much time trying to recover from the error. In most kinds of <em>RAID</em>, the failure tolerance is 1 drive - if all drives have TLER disabled, it may result in the self-destruction of the entire <em>RAID</em> due entirely to non-fatal errors. Rebuilding a failed disk in a RAID5 is not a quick process and can put a lot of stress on other drives.</p>
