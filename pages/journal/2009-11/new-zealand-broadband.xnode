	<p>I live in New Zealand. Decent internet access is a problem - its slow and expensive. Statistics like <a href="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2009/10/raw.jpg">these</a> make me so frustrated.</p>
	
	<p>Out of our household, internet costs about 1/4 of all our monthly bills. It seems like that is far too much. When we are in Japan, internet is pratically unlimited and extremely fast.</p>
	
	<p>The biggest issue I believe facing New Zealand is the fact that ISPs are becoming less neutral. For example, our [current] ISP <a href="http://www.orcon.net.nz/">Orcon</a> does not charge for bandwidth to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a>. On the surface, this may seem innocent enough.. but this makes Orcon a biased provider. I believe they are doing this for other sites too. What happens when they make a deal with one of the local TV companies, and not another? Will it depend what ISP you sign up for, what sites you can access?</p>
	
	<p>If you don't know about the whole situation, I recommend you read about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_neutrality">net neutrality</a> before its <a href="http://i7.tinypic.com/5z6vt4n.jpg">too late!</a></p>
